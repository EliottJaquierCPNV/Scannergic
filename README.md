# Scannergic (Frontend mobile client)
## Introduction

### General idea of the project

Our idea is to develop an android application which would allow people with allergies to fill them in the app, scan the barcode of a product and quickly know if they can eat the product or not. So the application knows, according to the different allergies, which product can be eaten or not.

### Goal

This application aims at simplifying people with allergies' life allowing them to quickly know if they can eat a product or not.
This android app will request the API of the 'Scannergic Backend' project and display the infos

#### First build and deploying
Clone the project
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/EliottJaquierCPNV/Scannergic.git
```
Make sure git lfs is installed (git lfs is used for the images in this project)
``` bash
git lfs install
```
Switch the 'developp' branch

#### Tests
For the tests to succeed, the url 'https://scannergic.diduno.education/' must be accessible (it may not work depending on the schedule)
If the API (Scannergic.diduno.education) is not accessible, all tests will succeed except those contained in the test class 'TestApiRequest'
