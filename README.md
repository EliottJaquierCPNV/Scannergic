# Scannergic (Frontend mobile client)
## Introduction

### General idea of the project

Our idea is to develop an android application which would allow people with allergies to fill them in the app, scan the barcode of a product and quickly know if they can eat the product or not. So the application knows, according to the different allergies, which product can be eaten or not.

### Goal

This application aims at simplifying people with allergies' life allowing them to quickly know if they can eat a product or not.
This android app will request the API of the 'Scannergic Backend' project and display the infos

## Prerequisites to collaborate 
visual Studio (2019 community is used) with packages :
 - Mobile developpement .NET (Xamarin) [Install xamarin package](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/xamarin/hello-world-tutorial/install)

An android phone to test [Phone setup on Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/xamarin/hello-world-tutorial/devicesetup) :
 - A physical phone with USB debugging enabled [Link to USB debugging](https://www.frandroid.com/comment-faire/tutoriaux/229753_questcequelemodedebogageusb)
 - Or an emulator (used below)

#### To open documentations
- Balsamiq Wireframe / Mockup

- Astah Community / UML

## First build and deploying
Clone the project
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/EliottJaquierCPNV/Scannergic.git
```
Make sure git lfs is installed (git lfs is used for the images in this project)
``` bash
git lfs install
```
Switch the 'develop' branch
``` bash
git checkout develop

```
Open your project is visual studio (Project in /ScannergicMobile/ScannergicMobile.sln)

Wait a few minutes until all prerequisites are initialized

Compile your project

Run the tests (see the 'Note for tests' section before running)

#### Deploying on emulator
Click on the play icon to setup an emulator

Create the default emulator

Wait until the download is complete

Start for the first time the emulator

When the emulator is started, click on the new play button in Visual Studio.

If you have a deployment error, look at the points below:
- Make sure you have started the emulator (it should be on the home page)
- Try deploying again 1 minute after the first failed deployment. (In some cases, the first deployment fails because it activated an emulator initialization procedure) 
- You don't have a valid key for the application (See 'Note for deploying')

From now on, the application should run on the emulator! See the 'Note for the scan' section during the first scan.

### Note for tests
For the tests to succeed, the url 'https://scannergic.diduno.education/' must be accessible (it may not work depending on the schedule)

If the API (Scannergic.diduno.education) is not accessible, all tests will succeed except those contained in the test class 'TestApiRequest'

### Note for the scan
During the first scan and camera permission request, the application crashes. This is a known bug. Restart the application and the scan will work perfectly.

To use the camera in emulator mode, maintain ALT.
Move the mouse to move the head and press W,A,S,D to move

For scanning a product, you will need to change the image in the emulator. Go to the settings/camera/ and add the product EAN13 code. (Under Doc\TestEAN13Code, you will have the demo codes)

### Note for deploying

If you want to sign you app for deployement or you have an error like this :	XA4310: `$(AndroidSigningKeyStore)` file `...` could not be found (This mean that the project a signing key. The key is not on the depot for security), you will need to change the key or delete it.

Change it or disable the option.
