# Scannergic (Frontend mobile client)
## Introduction

### General idea of the project

Our idea is to develop an android application which would allow people with allergies to fill them in the app, scan the barcode of a product and quickly know if they can eat the product or not. So the application knows, according to the different allergies, which product can be eaten or not.

### Goal

This application aims at simplifying people with allergies' life allowing them to quickly know if they can eat a product or not.
This android app will request the API of the 'Scannergic Backend' project and display the infos
